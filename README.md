## Data Visualization - Project2

This mini project was intended to practice more with other matplotlib 1D figures, namely scatterplots. In this project, I did so by plotting stock market indices from CSV files taken from Federal Reserve Economic Data. The three main CSV files of interest were the following: DJIA, NASDAQ, SP500. In this project I practiced reading, cleaning, and plotting through implementation of several helper functions.

Links to the CSV files named above are listed here:
